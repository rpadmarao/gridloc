# GridLoc

> A Vue.js project
A big amount of the world's population lacks street addresses. Cheap smartphones and GPS's can allow a system to be adopted
as a solurion so that people would be able to communicate location information to each other.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
