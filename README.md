# GridLoc

> A big amount of the world's population lacks street addresses. Cheap smartphones and GPS's can allow a system to be adopted
as a solution so that people would be able to communicate location information to each other.
This project aims to solve that problem by writing an implementation of the Maidenhead Locator System, a system usually
used by Amatuer radio operators to describe their location. Typically it's made with 8 digits but our implementation
used 10 digits which would allow us to map the world into roughly a 10 meter accuracy.

## Build Setup
